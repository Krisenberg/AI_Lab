He asked her why she was leaving him and she told him that she had heard awful things about him. \"What could they possibly have said to make you move out?\" \"They told me that you were a pedophile.\" He replied, \"That's an awfully big word for a ten year old.\"\n",

The attendant runs out of the station to serve them when Hillary realizes it's an old boyfriend from high school. She and the attendant chat as he gases up their car and cleans the windows. Then they all say good-bye. As Bill pulls the car onto the road, he turns to Hillary and says, 'Now aren't you glad you married me and not him ? You could've been the wife of a grease monkey !' To which Hillary replied, 'No, Bill. If I would have married him, you'd be pumping gas and he would be the President !'\n",

Discouraged, the guy goes to his car to sulk when inspiration strikes: He's got jumper cables in the trunk! So he wraps them around his neck, sort of like a string tie (a bulky string tie to be sure) and returns to the bar. The maitre d' is reluctant, but says to the guy, \"Okay, you're a pretty resourceful fellow, you can come in... but just don't start anything\"!\n",
